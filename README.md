# Recommendations
In the module, we have conducted only last one year data and the weather data is between years 2010 to 2017, its better to compare atleast last 5 years data for highest precipitation months and provide more concrete support to analysis.

Another approach would be another turist location(s) analysis with least amount of precition for more than 8 - 9 months (year around).
